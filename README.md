## 🧑🏻‍💻 Hi, I’m Eder <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Readme-Workflows/Readme-Icons@main/icons/wave/"/>
 _( It's pronounced like "better" without the "b")_

My background is in audio engineering. I've had the pleasure of working on Grammy nominated projects with some of my favorite artists, but in 2022 I decided to pursue a career with more room for growth.

As an audio engineer I was the person in the background making sure everything in the song was up to industry standards. I was the last line of defense making sure the songs were as perfect as possible before they were pushed into streaming services for the consumers to enjoy.

I realized these skills would be extremely transferrable in the QA field 🔎 🐞
